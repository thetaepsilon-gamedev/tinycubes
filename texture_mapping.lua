--[[
The cube entities internally store references to which material (node),
and which face, they take textures from,
as well as the coordinates (UV style, [0..1]) of the region of that texture.
This allows them to look like a fragment of that node's surface.

However, some textures are a higher resolution that others,
and may even change between runs
(e.g. if higher resolution textures are configured).
Further complicating matters is the fact that
MT doesn't let us dynamically set UV sample coordinates into a texture at runtime
(despite the GPU probably being more than capable of this...).
Instead, for entities we can only specify textures using MT's texture modifiers,
and these do not allow us to use UV coordinates.
The closest modifiers we have are only specified in exact pixels.
This leads to a problem where a UV coordinate may be halfway into a pixel,
so we need to do *something* to such cases or the modifier won't work.

Here, we map these UV coordinates back to pixel coordinates.
The lower bounds are rounded down, and the upper bounds rounded up.
This has the property that e.g. 1/16th cubes sampling an 8x8 texture
will Do The Right Thingâ„¢ visually, where two 1/16th cubes next to each other
(the first having e.g. U=0..1/16 and the second having U=1/16..2/16)
will both visually take on the first pixel in the texture.
Non-power-of-two sized textures may not fare so well here,
however this mod isn't really intended for such odd textures to begin with.

@INTERFACE texture_query
First, a concept to introduce:
For a given node/material and tile face (0-5, see node def tiles={...}),
we need a function which will return a) the texture string,
and b) the dimensions of this texture.
MT doesn't have a way to query (b), so we have to have it stored elsewhere.

query :: node_material -> Int -> Maybe (String, Int, Int)
-- Maybe here means it may return nil's if the lookup fails; e.g. material missing.
-- otherwise returns three values: base texture, width, height, in that order.
-- node_material doesn't have to be a string; it is an opaque type,
--   and can be anything that describes a node material (e.g. brick overlay modifier?).
